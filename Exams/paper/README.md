The document titled “Recognition of Abstract Objects Via Neural Oscillators: Interaction Among Topological Organization, Associative Memory and Gamma Band Synchronization” was published in the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks in February 2009. ￼ It explores the role of gamma-band neural oscillations in perceptual and cognitive processes. The authors propose a neural network model using Wilson-Cowan oscillators to simulate the recognition of abstract objects, each represented by a set of four features. These features are organized in topological maps of oscillators connected through associative memory. The study investigates how the interaction between topological organization, associative memory, and gamma-band synchronization contributes to the recognition of abstract objects.
