To calculate the **total yearly cost per subscriber** for 5G spectrum in France, we can estimate based on the following:

### Known Data:
1. **Total 5G Spectrum License Fees**: €2.786 billion (over 15 years, as 5G licenses in France are typically valid for 15 years).
2. **Total Subscribers**: ~76.8 million (current mobile subscriptions in France).
3. **Duration of License**: 15 years.

### Steps to Calculate Yearly Cost per Subscriber:
1. **Yearly Cost of Spectrum**:
   \[
   \text{Yearly Cost of Spectrum} = \frac{\text{Total License Fees}}{\text{License Duration}}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{2.786 \, \text{billion}}{15} = \text{€185.73 million per year}
   \]

2. **Cost per Subscriber per Year**:
   \[
   \text{Cost per Subscriber per Year} = \frac{\text{Yearly Cost of Spectrum}}{\text{Total Subscribers}}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{185.73 \, \text{million}}{76.8 \, \text{million}} = \text{€2.42 per subscriber per year}
   \]

### Final Result:
The **total yearly cost per subscriber** for 5G spectrum fees in France is approximately **€2.42**.  

This cost reflects only the spectrum licensing fee and does not include other operational, infrastructure, or service costs borne by operators, which also influence subscriber charges.
